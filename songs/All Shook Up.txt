{title: All Shook Up}

A well’a[G] bless my soul what's wrong with me? 
I'm itching like a man in a fuzzy tree 
My friends say I'm actin’ wild as a bug 
I'm in love (STOP) I'm all shook up 
Mm, mm, [C]mm, mm, [D7]mm,    [G]yeah, yeah, yeah
Well my [G]hands are shaky and my knees are weak 
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet 
Who do you think of when you have such luck? 
I'm in love (STOP)    I'm all shook up 
Mm, mm, [C]mm, mm, [D7]mm,    [G]yeah, yeah, yeah
